freeRTOS on RISC-V MCU CH32Vxxx

setting up freeRTOS on MRS could not be easier...  They have the template already made up.

1). Create a directory on you computer to use as a workspace.

2). Open MRS specifying this directory as the workspace. - Hit the "Launch" button.

2a). (optional) I like to set up the dark theme by clicking on Window -> Preferences -> General -> Appearance
	  and selecting Theme = "Dark"  as well as  Color and Font themes = "Classic Theme".  Applu and close.
	  
3).  Click on "Create new MounRiver project".   Do the following steps on the order indicated (important)

4).  unClick the "ARM Core" box

5).  Select the "FreeRTOS" in the Template Type drop down.

6).  Select MCU Family eg. CH32V203 [RISC-V]

7).  There should only be 1 option autoselected in the right-hand column.  such as CH32V203-FreeRTOS

8).  You may wish to change the Project Name at the top to a name of your choosing

....  hit Finish and...  whizz...  whirr...  and you have a ready to build project.
